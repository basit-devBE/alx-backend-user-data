# User Authentication Service

The User Authentication Service is a crucial component of any application that requires user authentication and authorization. It provides a secure and reliable way to manage user accounts, handle user registration and login, and enforce access control.

- User Login: Provides a mechanism for users to authenticate themselves using their credentials and gain access to protected resources.
- Password Encryption: Ensures that user passwords are securely stored by using strong encryption algorithms.
- Access Control: Implements role-based access control (RBAC) to restrict access to certain resources based on user roles and permissions.
- Password Reset: Enables users to reset their forgotten passwords through a secure password reset process.
- Account Deactivation: Allows users to deactivate or delete their accounts if they no longer wish to use the service.
